# Hi, I'm Timurlenk üëã

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a vibe coder, which means I code with energy, curiosity, and excitement for what's new and next. Right now, I'm diving deep into the world of **web3**: learning, experimenting, and building wherever inspiration strikes. Whether it's smart contracts, dApps, or exploring the decentralized future, I'm all about hands-on discovery.

I believe in learning by doing, sharing what I know, and always keeping things positive and collaborative. My projects are a mix of experiments, open-source contributions, and things that just seemed fun to try.

### What I'm up to

- Exploring web3 protocols and the magic of blockchain technology  
- Building decentralized apps and playing with smart contracts  
- Following the latest in DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and more  
- Connecting with other devs and creators who want to shape the future
